# Game Settings Fix Addon

There are various situations in which the game will overwrite any custom changes you've made to your `localSettings.json`. This usually happens when you visit the in-game settings menu and it resets FPS back to 60 and Particles back to 25. Sometimes even when the developers push updates they'll include their own settings which overwrite your own.

When this happens - your BPH will suffer. This is an AddOn for Script Hub that will try to fix the settings when that happens.

*Note: This can only change the settings while the game is closed. So - typically during offline stacking - but it may also catch it if the Gem Farm script forces a game restart due to getting stuck or the like.*
