# BrivGemFarm_Events
## Description:
This Addon pauses the script and alerts the user when Briv will not have stacks to reach the min stack zone on the next run.
> Updated: Extra requirements are a Tatyana with enough ilvls to allow Briv to stack in areas < 50.

## Instructions:
Instructions:
1. Set up Briv Gem farm normally.
2. Add Tatyana to Favorite #2 (W) team to help Briv with stacking online.
3. Enable the addon from Script Hub's Addon Manager.
4. Set modron reset area to 50.
5. Update BrivGemFarm settings.
   1. Set ``Farm SB Stacks After This Zone`` to at least one skip before 50.
   2. Set ``Minimum zone Briv can farm stacks on`` to at least one skip before 50.
   3. Set stacks to auto detect (preferrable for 100% jump brivs) or manually set to target stacks needed to get to zone 50.
   4. In Advanced Settings set ForceOfflineGemThreshold and/or ForceOfflineRunThreshold (preferrable) or disable offline stacking in main settings.
6.  Disable the addon in the Addon manager when not running events.


Notes:
> Offline stacking will not function if briv can kill enemies which is very likely below z50.
