### IC_NoModronAdventuring_Extra

This is a fork of Antilectual's [IC_NoModronAdventuring_Extra](https://github.com/antilectual/IC_Addons/tree/main/IC_Addons/IC_NoModronAdventuring_Extra) addon that adds a few extra features.

### IC_PotionSustain_Extra

An addon of my own make that attempts to sustain potions by buying Silver chests when necessary and has the ability to alternate the potions set in the modron.
