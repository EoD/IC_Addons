# No Modron Adventuring
## Description:
An add on based on mikebaldi's No Modron Leveling that will level and specialize champions, spam ultimates, and reset adventures with no modron automation. It is meant to help automate progress to get to the point where the player has automation on their core and can get Briv, at which point it is *highly* recommended to swap to using Briv Gem Farm.

## Instructions:
Instructions:
1. If it is your first time using, press the 'Select/Create Spec. Settings' button and select the desired specializations for each champion.
2. If it is your first time using, press the 'Load Max. Lvl Data' button.
3. In game, load the desires formations to formation favorites 1/Q.
4. Enter the last area you want the adventure to restart at.
5. Press the 'Start Modronless Adventuring' Button.

> Note: If a champion rework or rebalance results in different or new upgrades you may need to repeat Instruction steps 1 and 2.

Known Issues:
1. Occasionally, the upgrade lists are not read correctly from memory. You will know this is the case when the Select Specialization window opens and champions you own are not present or the drop down lists to select specializations are blank. If this occurs, please make sure the game is running and reload the script.
2. The script can click before the specialization window appears or after it is gone, resulting in a champion formation dialogue opening. This should not interfere with the script functionality.
