# No Modron Adventuring
## Description:
An add on based on mikebaldi's No Modron Leveling that will level and specialize champions, spam ultimates, and reset adventures with no modron automation. It is meant to help automate progress to get to the point where the player has automation on their core and can get Briv, at which point it is *highly* recommended to swap to using Briv Gem Farm.
